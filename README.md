## Project Description

It's a react based app where one can select pets to add to the cart. But they can only select 4 pets. If they try to add more, an alert message will pop up. Also, by clicking the 'choose 1 for me' button, a random pet will be selected from the cart. Moreover, 'Choose Again' button will clear the cart so that people can add pets to the cart again and repeat the same. The delete icon in the cart will delete a single pet element from there and whenever the cart is empty clicking 'Choose 1 for me' button will also show a pop up alert. Here, local storage is used to store information and to retrieve them. And the delete operation deletes the data from there.

More features might be added to the project later on.
